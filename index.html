        <h1 class="text-center p-5">What if you had a system that GUARANTEED you would win the money game?</h1>

        <p>I'm not talking about a course with a 100%, no-questions-asked money-back guarantee. I'm talking about something so powerful that that the only way you wouldn't win is if you consciously decided not to. Even if you feel like you know nothing about personal finance today.</p>
  
        <p>This sounds crazy... I know.</p>
  
        <p>It sounds too good to be true... I know</p>
  
        <p>But it's real.</p>
  
        <p>After countless hours over many years of research, building, tearing down, rebuilding, banging my head against the wall, and other activities that happen out of frustration, the idea for the RF Platform was born.</p>
  
        <p>Whether you want to learn how to budget, get out of debt, spend more responsibly, figure out what to invest in, create a winning financial strategy, increase your earning power, rewire your money mindset, start a business, attain financial freedom, travel the world, take a hiatus from work, retire in style – you name it, the RF Platform brings you the support, resources, and relationships you need when you need them.</p>

        <p>Wait, relationships?</p>

        <p>Yes. Let's face it. Everything you need to win with money is <span class="font-italic">out there</span>.</p>

        <p>It's in

            and many other places. You can learn to win with money completely for free completely on your own. All the information you need is everywhere!
        </p>

        <p>In fact, the first thing I'll send you after you take the intro survey is a playlist showing you exactly how to build the personal finance system that helped me retire at 26. I started from scratch so I could record every step of the process. It's my gift to you. No charge!</p>

        <p>So what's stopping you?</p>

        <p>If you're like me, and millions of others, you've realized it has nothing to do with the availability of resources. It can't be – there's plenty of information out there.</p>

        <p>There's something else.</p>

        <p>Something you <span class="font-weight-bold">can't</span> get from simply consuming content.</p>

        <p>Something you only get out of a relationship.</p>

        <p>That's why you're here.</p>

        <p>That's why we're here.</p>

        <p>I used to work at a company that excelled at what it did because it understood that lack of information is not the problem, and getting more of it, more often than not, was a waste of time. It knew that in order to win, you needed to get the right information to the right person at the right time.</p>

        <p>Winning the money game is no different.</p>

        <p>But you need to take it one step further than content consumption, because the right relationship at the right time with the right person makes all the difference in the world.</p>

        <p>We understand that, and the system is simply a facilitator.</p>

        <p>The technology behind the RF Platform is currently under construction, but that doesn't stop anything. We just do things a bit more <span class="font-italic">manually</span> in the meantime.</p>

        <p>Your first step is to take a short survey. You'll answer a few questions to let us know who you are, where you are, and where you want to go.</p>
