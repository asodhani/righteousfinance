    </div>
    
    <p>I'm not talking about a course with a 100%, no-questions-asked money-back guarantee. I'm talking about something so powerful that that the only way you wouldn't win is if you consciously decided not to. Even if you feel like you know nothing about personal finance today.</p>

    <p>This sounds crazy... I know.</p>

    <p>It sounds too good to be true... I know</p>

    <p>But it's real.</p>

    <p>After countless hours over many years of research, building, tearing down, rebuilding, banging my head against the wall, and other activities that happen out of frustration, the idea for the RF Platform was born.</p>

    <p>Whether you want to learn how to budget, get out of debt, spend more responsibly, figure out what to invest in, create a winning financial strategy, increase your earning power, buy a house, rewire your money mindset, start a business, attain financial freedom, travel the world, take a hiatus from work, retire in style, road trip across America, post really nice pictures of yourself at Machu Picchu  – you name it, the RF Platform brings you the support, resources, and relationships you need when you need them.</p>

    <p>Wait, relationships?</p>

    <p>Yes. Let's face it. Everything you need to win with money is <span class="font-italic">out there</span>.</p>

      and many other places. You can learn to win with money completely for free completely on your own. All the information you need is everywhere!
    </p>

    <p>In fact, the first thing I'll send you after you take the intro survey is a playlist showing you exactly how to build the personal finance system that helped me retire at 26. I started from scratch so I could record every step of the process. It's my gift to you. No charge!</p>

    <p>So what's stopping you?</p>

    <p>If you're like me, and millions of others, you've realized it has nothing to do with the availability of resources. It can't be – there's plenty of information out there.</p>

    <p>There's something else.</p>

    <p>Something you <span class="font-weight-bold">can't</span> get from simply consuming content.</p>

    <p>Something you only get out of a relationship.</p>

    <p>That's why you're here.</p>

    <p>That's why we're here.</p>

    <p>I used to work at a company that excelled at what it did because it understood that lack of information is not the problem, and getting more of it, more often than not, was a waste of time. It knew that in order to win, you needed to get the right information to the right person at the right time.</p>

    <p>Winning the money game is no different.</p>

    <p>But you need to take it one step further than content consumption, because the right relationship at the right time with the right person makes all the difference in the world.</p>

    <p>We understand that, and the system is simply a facilitator.</p>

    <p>The technology behind the RF Platform is currently under construction, but that doesn't stop anything. We just do things a bit more <span class="font-italic">manually</span> in the meantime.</p>

    <p>Your first step is to take a short survey. You'll answer a few questions to let us know who you are, where you are, and where you want to go.</p>

    <div class="text-center">
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehxMVel-0Uz5ziN_UiaK7vWTTVGfauDChuBz_6mAAJ7N0JaA/viewform?usp=sf_link" class="btn btn-info m-3">I'm Ready to Win</a>
    </div>

    <p>There's nothing to buy on this page. The survey isn't some formality to put you at the top of a sales funnel.</p>

    <p>That's not to say RF doesn't sell products or services. We do.</p>

    <p>(In fact, I think the best way to describe how we serve our clients is best said by Swifty McVay in <a href="https://youtu.be/yexJnfFqpaY?t=62" target="_blank">line two of the hook of the song Whatever you Want</a>)</p>

    <p>But we cannot help you if you don't know what you want.</p>

    <p>Nobody can.</p>

    <p>And buying something from a page of copy that appeals to your emotions is not an effective way to go about getting what you want, because there are things you need to sort out in your life first, like mindset, discipline, and confidence before you can have success with such a program. I know this from experience.</p>

    <p>The first question to the survey is critical. That's why it's first. I've noticed that there is so much that we want to do in our lives, but feel like we can't do them due to financial lack.</p>

    <blockquote class="blockquote font-italic">"I <span class="bold">have to</span> go to work so I can make money to do what I love, but <span class="bold">because</span> I spend so much time at work, I barely have the time or energy to do what I love."</blockquote>

    <p>Sound familiar?</p>

    <!-- <p>The answer to the question, <span class="font-italic">"What would you do if you had unlimited money?"</span> is important for two reasons: </p> -->

    <p>The answer to the first question is super important for to reasons:</p>

    <p>First, it <span class="font-weight-bold">prompts us to recall our purpose</span>, or what we believe it to be. In our busy day-to-day lives, it is very easy to get caught up in the grind and lose sight of the big picture. It takes an absurdly exaggerated question to allow yourself to think freely. A few seconds after you read the question, notice how your thoughts try to tell you how dumb the question is, that it's not real, not possible, and any other excuses to try to constrain your vision.</p>

    <p>Second, <span class="font-weight-bold">There is no answer you can come up with that actually requires an unlimited amount of money.</span> In other words, your <abbr title="Yes, it's a beaten to death cliché.">dream is possible</abbr>. And many, when they put plan and numbers to paper, are eager to start executing when they see how soon it can be attained.</p>

    <p>When you start asking, <span class="font-italic">"do I really want that?"</span> and the answer is no, the beautiful thing is, <span class="font-weight-bold">the destination can be changed without changing the path.</span> To me, that makes money incredibly interesting.</p>

    <p>That's why you start with a declaration.</p>

    <div class="text-center">
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehxMVel-0Uz5ziN_UiaK7vWTTVGfauDChuBz_6mAAJ7N0JaA/viewform?usp=sf_link" class="btn btn-info m-3">Declare your Dream</a>

    Feedback:

    Lodhi:
    ok, let's do this. so i am reviewing it as a ordinary person logging in to see what you're about, not as a Financial industry person.
    Pros: convo style of writing, i like been talked with rather than talked to, simple language, not a lot of jargons, create a need and pain point.
    Improves: a little too vague, i am not sure what exactly i am expected to do. and what results am i looking for. it was long, try to trim it. a few more hooks.

    Something you can't get from simply consuming content. This point need to be used more, that should be your big selling point to drive home


    Arthur:
    are you planning to narrarate it?
    put the declare your dream button at the top as well
    it makes people wonder more because there's a button, but why should i press it
